# Sappho Digital

Over the centuries, the ancient Greek poet Sappho has been imagined and reimagined in countless ways. More than 1,000 German-language texts from the 15th to the 21st century reference Sappho in ways that range from quotation and allusion to fictionalization and stylistic imitation. My dissertation project documents and analyzes these forms of *productive literary reception* using Linked Data. This repository stores the corresponding data.

For a detailed description of the project and the data, see the [project website](https://sappho-digital.com/about.html), which is based on the [DSE-Static-Cookiecutter](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dse-static-cookiecutter). If, for whatever reason, the website becomes unavailable, you can access an archived version via the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).

This repository contains:
- [XML/TEI files](https://github.com/laurauntner/sappho-digital/tree/main/data/lists) listing testimonies of the productive literary reception of Sappho. 
- Scripts used for data transformation and satistics ([XSLT](https://github.com/laurauntner/sappho-digital/tree/main/xslt) and [Python](https://github.com/laurauntner/sappho-digital/tree/main/python)).

⚠️ This repository is under active development. Soon, there will also be an OWL ontology for modeling biographical, bibliographical, and intertextual information; a SKOS vocabulary for the literary reception of Sappho; and sample analyses of around 100 literary reception testimonies. To get an idea of the data model, see the companion repository [wikidata-to-cidoc-crm](https://github.com/laurauntner/wikidata-to-cidoc-crm). This repository contains Python scripts for converting structured data from Wikidata into RDF using CIDOC CRM, LRMoo, and INTRO.

# Sappho Digital

Over the centuries, the ancient Greek poet Sappho has been imagined and reimagined in countless ways. More than 1,000 German-language texts reference Sappho in ways that range from quotation and allusion to fictionalization and stylistic imitation. This project documents and analyzes these forms of *productive literary reception* using Linked Data. This repository provides data related to this literary reception of Sappho in German-speaking countries from the 15th to the 21st century. It is part of the dissertation project by Laura Untner ([laura.untner@fu-berlin.de](mailto:laura.untner@fu-berlin.de)). 

For a detailed description of the project, see the [project website](https://sappho-digital.com/about.html), based on the [DSE-Static-Cookiecutter](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dse-static-cookiecutter). If, for whatever reason, the website becomes unavailable, see the archived version via the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).

This repository contains:
- [XML/TEI files](https://github.com/laurauntner/sappho-digital/tree/main/data/lists) listing testimonies of productive literary reception. 
- Scripts used for data transformation and sorting. The lists are generated locally with Python scripts from an Excel file and are then sorted with xslt/sort.xsl and xslt/n-bibl.xsl.

To get an idea of the data model that will be applied in the project, see also the companion repository [wikidata-to-cidoc-crm](https://github.com/laurauntner/wikidata-to-cidoc-crm). This repository contains Python scripts for converting structured data from Wikidata into RDF using CIDOC CRM, LRMoo, and INTRO.
